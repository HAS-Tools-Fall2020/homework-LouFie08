# Lourdes Fierro. September 6th, 2020. Assignment 2

- This time I looked at two specific but separate dates for each week for 2016 and 2019.

- Once I got those values, I kind of guessed the same week flow value for this year.

- I also plotted a portion of days for 2019 and 2020 to help me identifying an overall tendency in the data.

# Grade
3/3 - great job!
