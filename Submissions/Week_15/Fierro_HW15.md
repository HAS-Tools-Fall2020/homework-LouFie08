### Reflection

1. What resources did you request on Ocelote? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?
I requested 1 node, 1 core, for the standard queue for 05:00 minutes of cpu time. I waited for the job to be submitted less than ten seconds. It took six seconds to run.
2. What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Ocelote?
I was unsure about the setup for the account at the beginning, as well as the pip installation (I was unsure whether the packages would have conflicts between installation)
3. Where else did you run your job? How did the setup compare to your run on Ocelote?
I used Google colab. The code structure is similar in both cases, however in google I don't need to run a pbs file or/and submit the job.
4. What questions do you still have after doing this?
- In the case of google colab I'm not sure if I need to pip install all packages every time I run a script. Is there a way to set/create an environment (similar to Ocelote machine)?
- How can function files be called in the main script (Google colab)?
- What happens if the time resources in Ocelote run out? Can I request more time?

Notes: I ran a jupyter notebook in google colab, and a python file in Ocelote.
