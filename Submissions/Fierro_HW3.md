# # Analysis
1. Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?
- Flow: This object is a list which is composed of 11578 float elements.
- Year: This object is a list composed of 11578 int elements.
- Month: This object is a list composed of 11578 int elements.
- Day: This object is a list composed of 11578 int elements.

2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?
- Prediction one week forecast: The percentage where the daily flow in September is greater than my prediction is 99.57537154989384 and the total number of times the daily flow is greater than my prediction is 938 times.
- Prediction two week forecast: The percentage where the daily flow in September is greater than my prediction is 95.96602972399151 and the total number of times the daily flow is greater than my prediction is 904 times.

3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)
- Daily flows in or before year 2000: For week one, the forecast value percentage is 100.00 and the total number of times is 360. For week two, the forecast value percentage is 100.00 and the total number of times is 360.
- daily flows in or after year 2000: For week one, the forecast value percentage is 99.34640522875817 and the total number of times is 608. For week two, the forecast value percentage is 93.79084967320262 and the total number of times is 574.

4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

The daily flow  value in the first half of September is usually higher than the second half, however there are a few years where this tendency is inverted (the first half flow value is lower than the second half of the month).


5. Forecast decision process for the 1st and 2nd week

- The firs thing I did was to estimate the max, min, mean and standard deviation values for the one weak forecast of interest per year data. After I got the values for last year, I compared the results with past recent years (from 2015 to 2019). I also checked the flow from last week to give me an idea about the current tendency.

- For the seasonal Forecast I did the same analysis changing the week dates according to the pdf information.
